                        <p>
                            Today is not just a celebration of another year in your life, but a testament to your strength, resilience, and unwavering spirit. 
                            I know your journey hasn't always been easy‚Äîthere were days when the darkness felt overwhelming, when your steps felt heavy, and your heart was filled with doubt. 
                            But look at you now, my love. You have fought, endured, and risen above it all. 
                            You have proven that even when storms rage, the rainbow always awaits on the other side. 
                            I am so incredibly proud of you, more than words can ever express. 
                            You are a light that continues to shine, even when you feel dim. 
                            Today, I hope you celebrate not just your birthday, but also the incredible strength that lies within you. 
                            I love you, and I will always be by your side. üíñ‚ú®
